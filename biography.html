    Our heart goes to the fallen heroes who fought and held their ground till death for the fight of unity, good governance and immediate halt to police brutality and extortion.
               Although we do not know so much about the victims personally, here is a list of some of the fallen heroes brutalized and killed by the <strong> Special Anti Robbery Squad</strong> 
<br/><br/>
1. Emmanuel Egbo
<br/><br/>
Emmanuel Egbo is a 15-year-old boy killed by a police officer in Enugu on 25 September 2008. He was playing with his fellow children and was unarmed.
<br/><br/>
2. Godgift Ferguson Ekerete
<br/><br/>
Godgift Ferguson Ekerete, 24, was arrested during a police raid in Port Harcourt alongside three others.
<br/><br/>
On the morning of 3rd of July 2008, a busload of armed policemen wearing mufti intercepted a group of four men waiting for a bus at Rumuomasi in Port Harcourt to take them to a burial ceremony. The men took off in fear of their lives and the policemen opened fire on them, arresting all four.
<br/><br/>

Godgift Ferguson Ekerete (aged 24),<br/> Tony Oruama (aged 21),<br/> Harry Ataria (aged 26) <br/>and Mbakwe Oruama (aged 20) were taken to the Mile One Police Station in Port Harcourt and, according to Amnesty International, were all killed at the police station the same day.
<br/><br/>
The policemen had labelled them “armed robbers and cultists” and their deaths were never investigated. The families of the victims who swore their sons were innocent never received an official account of the events that led to the deaths of their children.
<br/><br/>
4. Daniel Adewuyi Tella
<br/><br/>
Daniel Adewuyi Tella was a 27-year-old graduate of Banking and Finance. He was arrested on 7 February 2006 on his way home in Festac, Lagos. He died in police custody and the police later alleged that Daniel Adewuyi Tella sustained serious injuries when he jumped out of a moving police vehicle. His family did not believe this story and suspect their son was tortured to death at the police station.
<br/><br/>
5. Chika Ibeku
<br/><br/>
On 7 April 2009, the police stopped a car occupied by six men:
<br/><br/>

    <br/>
        Gabriel Ejoor Owoicho (29)<br/>
            Precious Odua (27) and two others.<br/>
They were arrested and detained at Omoku Police station, Rivers State. Their families were informed of their arrest. 
<br/> <br/>On 8 April, 
Johnson Nnaemeka (39), the owner of the car, was questioned at Omoku Police Station. He was arrested on 9 April, and his house was searched. That same day, all six men were taken to the Swift Operation Squad (SOS) in Old GRA, Port Harcourt. Police officers at SOS confirmed their detention. Their families were not allowed to see them after their transfer. On 11 April, police officers at SOS claimed the men were transferred to SARS. Officers at SARS denied this. To date, the whereabouts of the six men are unknown.
